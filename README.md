# Music Recommendation System (Hybrid Content-Based + LLM) ðŸŽ¶
## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced music recommendation system using the Spotify dataset. The system combines audio feature analysis with semantic embeddings from song titles and artists to provide personalized, content-based recommendations. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing with LLMs.

## The system demonstrates expertise in:

>Data preprocessing and feature engineering

>Machine learning for recommendation systems

>Natural language processing with LLMs

> Data visualization for interpretation

## Dataset

>> Source: Kaggle Spotify datasets (data.csv)

>>Number of songs: 170,653

>> Features include:

>> Numeric/audio: valence, danceability, energy, popularity, tempo, explicit, mode, key

>> Categorical: artist_encoded

>> Text: name + artist for LLM embeddings
